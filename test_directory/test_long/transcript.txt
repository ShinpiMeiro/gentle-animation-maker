Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is a special episode.
English Learning for Curious Minds is only just a couple of years old, but it
recently passed a million downloads. It feels strange to say this, but there we go.
So I wanted to mark the occasion with an extra special episode where I give you my best tips and tricks for how to use podcasts to improve your English.
